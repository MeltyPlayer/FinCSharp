# FinCSharp

This will be my FINal attempt at writing my own game engine from scratch. My [previous final attempt](https://github.com/MeltyPlayer/FinRpg) was via C++, which quickly went south because CMake doesn't work for me.

Within this repository will live the base engine itself, Fin, as well as the games I develop with it. Their fates will be intertwined; ideally, the games will improve as the framework grows, and the framework will improve as I discover new use cases to handle.

## Installation

TODO

## Simple

A relatively simple game. More to come.
